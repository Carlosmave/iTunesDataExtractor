Title: Caliber  9
Release Date: 1972-02-15
Rating: NR
Genre: Thriller
Short Description: A former gangster is forced to resume his old lifestyle when his violent, jealous ex-colleagues and the police believe that he knows the location of a stolen cache of $300,000.
Long Description: In the first film of the Fernando Di Leo triology, small-time gangster Ugo Piazza has just been released from prison. He tries to convince the police, the mafia, and his one-time associate Rocco, a sadistic hoodlum who enjoys sick violence and torture, that he wants to go straight, but everyone believes he has $300,000 of stolen money hidden somewhere. Caliber 9's stylized violence, fast-paced action sequences, tight editing and plot twists prefigure the work of Quentin Tarantino and John Woo. The film also features a notable score by Luis Bacalov and the stunning Barbara Bouchet as Ugo's go-go dancing girlfriend.
